        <p>Thank you for considering contributing to this project!</p>
<p>I want to make it as easy as possible for anyone who loves the work of sensei Tsutomu Nihei to contribute. For this reason I’ll list a number of ways you can take part in descending order of difficulty. The only hard requirement is to have a Github account.</p>
<h2 id="cibo-head-scientist">Cibo, head scientist</h2>
<p>Knowledge level:<br />
- git<br />
- Haskell or CSS</p>
<p>At this level, I assume you’re a developer or graphic designer and can help me set up a better website. Steps:<br />
- fork the <a href="https://github.com/sphaso/niheipedia">repo</a><br />
- work on your changes and submit a Pull Request for me to review. Please target the <code>dev</code> branch</p>
<h2 id="silicon-astronomer">Silicon astronomer</h2>
<p>Knowledge level:<br />
- git<br />
- markdown</p>
<p>At this level, I assume you know your way around git and have basic knowledge of the markdown format. You can either edit what’s written, add information, or even create new pages! Steps:<br />
- fork the <a href="https://github.com/sphaso/niheipedia">repo</a><br />
- work on your changes and submit a Pull Request for me to review. Please target the <code>dev</code> branch</p>
<h2 id="electro-fisherman">Electro fisherman</h2>
<p>Knowledge level:<br />
- manga</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you’d rather not go through the previous method, I would still like you to contribute! Just open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/sphaso/niheipedia">Github repository</a> with whatever correction or addendum you would like to see. If accepted, I will commit your change in a similar fashion as what would happen in the previous two tiers.</p>
<p>Please note, a downside of this is that since the commit in the repository won’t be done in your name, you won’t be listed in the Contributors page.</p>
