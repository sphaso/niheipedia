---

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

I want to make it as easy as possible for anyone who loves the work of sensei Tsutomu Nihei to contribute. For this reason I'll list a number of ways you can take part in descending order of difficulty. The only hard requirement is to have a Github account.


## Cibo, head scientist

Knowledge level:    
- git    
- Haskell or CSS    

At this level, I assume you're a developer or graphic designer and can help me set up a better website.
Steps:     
- fork the [repo](https://github.com/sphaso/niheipedia)     
- work on your changes and submit a Pull Request for me to review. Please target the `dev` branch


## Silicon astronomer

Knowledge level:    
- git    
- markdown    

At this level, I assume you know your way around git and have basic knowledge of the markdown format. You can either edit what's written, add information, or even create new pages!
Steps:    
- fork the [repo](https://github.com/sphaso/niheipedia)    
- work on your changes and submit a Pull Request for me to review. Please target the `dev` branch    


## Electro fisherman

Knowledge level:    
- manga

If for whatever reason you'd rather not go through the previous method, I would still like you to contribute! Just open an issue in the [Github repository](https://github.com/sphaso/niheipedia) with whatever correction or addendum you would like to see. If accepted, I will commit your change in a similar fashion as what would happen in the previous two tiers.    

Please note, a downside of this is that since the commit in the repository won't be done in your name, you won't be listed in the Contributors page.
