<h4>1 Chapter 1</h4>

<p><p>[World] “Maybe on Earth, maybe in the future”. Tsutomu sensei commented in an interview [CITATION NEEDED] that the universe of Blame could be as big as the solar system. If that’s so, assuming that these facts happen on Earth wouldn’t make sense. At the same time assuming that these facts don’t happen on Earth, might make it plausible that they’re not happening in the present. Interestingly, this premise is absent in the German master edition.</p>
<p>[Architecture] The opening three panels already show the link between Nihei-mangaka and Nihei-architect. The world of Blame! is in fact introduced in a classic orthogonal projection: it shows the bridge on which Killy is walking from above and from the two sides. This immediately gives a sense of scale. The world is both huge and claustrophibic. The organic shapes of the humans are in stark contrast with the perfect straight edges of the buildings. [IMAGE REFERENCE NEEDED]</p>
<p>[World] In the third panel, notice thunders and manta rays on the ceiling.</p>
<p>[Narration] Blame! is narrated “in medias res”. Nothing is explained upfront, the reader is supposed to pick up elements of the story for themself. In this case the kid Killy is walking with is surprised to find another human being. Some humans are after human cells?</p>
<p>[Narration] Is Blame! a circular story? The opening chapter has Killy with a kid with the net gene. At the same time, the manga ends with Killy and a kid.</p>
<p>[Character] Killy shows little emotion or care for others throughout the manga, this is common for male protagonists in other Nihei works (Biomega, Abara). Killy however often shows a slight grin before shooting his gun.</p>
<p>[Weapons] Killy uses his Gravitational Beam Gun for the first time in the manga. The use of extremely powerful and yet small guns is common in Nihei work, to the point of absurdity. For example see Biomega (destroying nuclear weapons with a shotgun) [IMAGE NEEDED]</p>
<p>[Silicon creatures] Two silicon creatures are introduced as antagonists. We still don’t know them as such.</p>
<p>[Technology] Technology is capable of recording what one sees and reproducing it through a plug in one’s head. One’s memory can be stored and saved. This is shared by the first victim of Killy, Killy himself and the Silicon creatures. Similar technology will be displayed in the sci-fi film Nirvana.</p>
<p>[Narration] In the English translation, the man who found Killy says “I’m sure he had a pure structure”. In the German and Italian translations, he says his genes were from before the infection.</p>
<p>[Shooting at the lower leg] The same happens in a panel in Abara [IMAGE NEEDED]</p>
<p>[Technology] Killy can use the technology around him, he does so to use a sort of machine gun against the two silicon creatures. He finds a dead person (a soldier?) in a suit. We’ll see similar suits in future panels [IMAGE]</p>
<p>[World] The statues on the long stairs resemble horde guards or the faces of silicon  android people throughout the manga. See also the masks in Knights of Sidonia. The last panels seem to suggest a link between the statues and Killy. [IMAGE NEEDED]</p></p>
